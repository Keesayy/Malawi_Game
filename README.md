### How to play ?

- `make` and then `./main`
- Each player starts with 6 pawns having 2 marbles each.
- Move a pawn : Horizontally or vertically the number of marbles of the pawn when no obstacles in sight.
- Split marbles : A pawn loses all of his marbles and give each one of them to his favorite brothers, if he has 6 marbles we lose 1 marble.
- Attack a pawn : Same as move except you do not move and the opponent pawn loses all his marbles.
- To win : A pawn is on the opponent back row unnaked and cannot be attacked or Opponent has no more marbles.
